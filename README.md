# odin_recipes

The aim of this project is to implment what I have currently learnt about HTML. This will include creating a new repo, cloning it onto my localhost, creating a basic boiler plate html and then adding onto this by linking to new pages, adding images, using different types of lists, header types. I will also ensure the local repo is well organised for ease of reference.
